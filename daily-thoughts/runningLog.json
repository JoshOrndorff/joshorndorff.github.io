When I got to the entrance I found that the park is only open on weekdays.

He wasn't sure what I was talking about, but he told me about a broken gate to get into an off-limits area that he thought might be what I was looking for.  I'm pretty sure it wasn't right, and the footing was loose, but the area was sweet anyway.  Eventually I ran back down the west route.  So, the search for the loop still isn't over.  I have some map studying to do.  The last mile or more of this run was pretty fast too.

The times and effective paces were as follows:</p><div style=\"font: monospace;\">400&nbsp; - 1:20 - 5:20<br /> 800&nbsp; - 2:39 - 5:18<br /> 1600 - 5:38 - 5:38<br /> 800&nbsp; - 2:47 - 5:34<br /> 400&nbsp; - 1:19 - 5:16</div><p>So obviously 6:00 pace was too easy, and even 5:45 pace would have been too easy. I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;ll do for the next workout. I&#39;ll definitely lower the pace a little probably either to 5:30, 5:35, or 5:40. I may also add an interval.
